### Proxy Pattern
    The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

üîç Purpose:
* Add extra behavior (like logging, security, caching) without changing the actual object.
* Control access to the real subject (expensive or sensitive objects).

üß± Types of Proxy:
| Type                 | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual Proxy**    | Delays creation until needed (lazy initialization) |
| **Protection Proxy** | Controls access (e.g., based on user roles)        |
| **Remote Proxy**     | Represents an object in a different JVM/machine    |
| **Smart Proxy**      | Adds extra behavior (logging, counting, etc.)      |

‚úÖ Example:
```java
interface Service {
    void doWork();
}

class RealService implements Service {
    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("RealService: Working...");
    }
}

class ProxyService implements Service {
    private RealService realService = new RealService();

    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("Proxy: Logging before");
        realService.doWork();
        System.out.println("Proxy: Logging after");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Service service = new ProxyService();
        service.doWork();
    }
}

// Output:
/*
Proxy: Logging before
RealService: Working...
Proxy: Logging after
*/
```

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass request along a chain of handlers.
    Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
* Examples
  1. Logging System
  2. ATM Machine
