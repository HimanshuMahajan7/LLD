### Proxy Pattern
    The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

üîç Purpose:
* Add extra behavior (like logging, security, caching) without changing the actual object.
* Control access to the real subject (expensive or sensitive objects).

üß± Types of Proxy:
| Type                 | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual Proxy**    | Delays creation until needed (lazy initialization) |
| **Protection Proxy** | Controls access (e.g., based on user roles)        |
| **Remote Proxy**     | Represents an object in a different JVM/machine    |
| **Smart Proxy**      | Adds extra behavior (logging, counting, etc.)      |

‚úÖ Example:
```java
interface Service {
    void doWork();
}

class RealService implements Service {
    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("RealService: Working...");
    }
}

class ProxyService implements Service {
    private RealService realService = new RealService();

    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("Proxy: Logging before");
        realService.doWork();
        System.out.println("Proxy: Logging after");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Service service = new ProxyService();
        service.doWork();
    }
}

// Output:
/*
Proxy: Logging before
RealService: Working...
Proxy: Logging after
*/
```

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass request along a chain of handlers.
    Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
* Examples
  1. Logging System
  2. ATM Machine - Cash Withdrawal

---
### Null Object Pattern
    The Null Object Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default "do nothing" behavior.
    Instead of returning null or requiring explicit null checks throughout the client code, this pattern introduces a special "null object" that implements the same interface as the real object but provides empty or default implementations for its methods.

* A null object replaces `NULL` return type.
* No need to put if check for checking null
* Null Object reflects do nothing or default behaviour.

* In short, the Null Object Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a non-functional default object in place of null.
* It helps avoid NullPointerException and eliminates the need to check for null everywhere.

üí° Intent:
* Replace null with a neutral object that does nothing but conforms to the expected interface.

‚úÖ Benefits:
| Feature              | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Avoids `null` checks | Eliminates `if (obj != null)` everywhere  |
| Cleaner code         | No risk of `NullPointerException`         |
| Implements interface | Behaves polymorphically with real objects |

üß± Structure:
* Interface (e.g., NotificationService)
* Real Implementation (e.g., EmailNotification)
* Null Implementation (e.g., NullNotification) ‚Äì does nothing

‚úÖ Example:
```java
interface NotificationService {
    void send(String message);
}

class EmailNotification implements NotificationService {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending email: " + message);
    }
}

class NullNotification implements NotificationService {
    public void send(String message) {
        // do nothing
    }
}

// Usage
public NotificationService getService(User user) {
    if (user == null) {
        return new NullNotification();  // no-op object
    } else {
        return new EmailNotification();
    }
}

```

### State Pattern
    The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

üîç Intent:
* Allow an object to behave differently based on its current state, and to change its behavior at runtime without using many if-else or switch statements.

üß± Structure:
* **Context**: Maintains a reference to a State object and delegates behavior to it.
* **State** (interface): Declares methods that concrete states will implement.
* **ConcreteState**: Implements state-specific behavior.

‚úÖ Example: Document State (Draft ‚Üí Moderation ‚Üí Published)
```java
// State interface
interface State {
    void handle();
}

// Concrete States
class DraftState implements State {
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("Document is in Draft State.");
    }
}

class ModerationState implements State {
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("Document is under Moderation.");
    }
}

class PublishedState implements State {
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("Document is Published.");
    }
}

// Context
class Document {
    private State currentState;

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.currentState = state;
    }

    public void applyState() {
        currentState.handle();
    }
}
```

üí° Real-World Examples:
| Scenario                | States                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| TCP Connection          | Open, Closed, Listening         |
| Media Player            | Playing, Paused, Stopped        |
| Order Processing System | New, Packed, Shipped, Delivered |

‚úÖ Benefits:
| Advantage             | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Avoids if-else chains | No need for long conditionals for state logic  |
| Clean separation      | Each state is self-contained                   |
| Easy to extend        | Add new states without modifying existing code |

üö´ Drawbacks:
* Can result in lots of classes if there are many states.
* Slightly complex setup compared to simple switch statements.

### Composite Pattern
    The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
    In other words, whether dealing with a single object or a group of objects (composite), clients can use them interchangeably.

üí° Intent:
* "Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies."

üîç Real-World Examples:
| Scenario                    | States                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| File System                 | File System, Folder, File                        |
| Arithmetic Expression       | Expression, Number, Operation                    |
| Graphical User Interfaces   | UI elements like panels, buttons and text fields |

‚úÖ Benefits:
| Benefit        | Explanation                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tree structure | Represents hierarchical structures clearly                                        |
| Uniformity     | Clients treat single and composite objects uniformly                              |
| Extensibility  | New components (Leaf or Composite) can be added easily                            |
| Recursive      | It enables operations to be applied recursively across the entire tree structure. |

### Adapter Design Pattern
    The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
    It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

üí° Intent:
* Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

üß± Key Components:
| Component | Role                                                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Client`  | The object that needs to use the functionality of another object.     |
| `Adaptee` | Existing class with incompatible interface                            |
| `Target`  | Expected interface (what client understands)                          |
| `Adapter` | Converts Adaptee to Target                                            |

üì¶ Real-Life Example:
* Power Adapter & Socket
* Memory Card, Card Reader, USB Socket
* XML to JSON Parser
* Weight Machine shownig reading only in pound, need an adapter
